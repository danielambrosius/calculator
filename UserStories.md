User stories (implemented ones are striked through)
=====================================================

1. ~~Display shows clicked numbers~~

>The number clicked in the "keypad" should show up in the "display"

2. ~~Clear button clears everything~~
>Clear button should clear the display, the stored values for left, right and "operator".

3. ~~The "operator" buttons should work~~
>When a operator button is clicked, the number in the display should be stored in the "left" variable, and the user should be able to enter the "right" number.

4. FIx whats broken
>the user should be able to enter multiple digits even though there is a value in the "left" buffer.
