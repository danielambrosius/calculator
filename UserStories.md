User stories (implemented ones are striked through)
=====================================================

1. ~~Display shows clicked numbers~~

>The number clicked in the "keypad" should show up in the "display"

2. ~~Clear button clears everything~~
>Clear button should clear the display, the stored values for left, right and "operator".

3. ~~The "operator" buttons should work~~
>When a operator button is clicked, the number in the display should be stored in the "left" variable, and the user should be able to enter the "right" number.

4. FIx whats broken
>~~the user should be able to enter multiple digits even though there is a value in the "left" buffer.~~
>~~The user should be able to chain together multiple operations *correctly*~~

5. Chaining after "equals"
>~~When the user evaluates an expression using "=", the user shal be able to change operator without the "previous" expression being evaluated~~

6. Decimal seperator.
>~~The user should be able to add *only one* decimal seperator to a number.~~

7. Backspace button.
>Backspace should remove the last digit entered

8. Styling.

9. Keyboard support.
> ~~Keyboard equivalents to the buttons on the calculator should workd~~
